      "content": "Rook and pawn endings are among the most common endgames in chess, yet they remain poorly understood by many players. The key principles include: activating your rook (ideally behind passed pawns), cutting off the opponent's king, and understanding the concept of the 'shouldering'. The Lucena position and Philidor position are fundamental theoretical positions every player must know. In this article, we'll examine practical examples from grandmaster games, showing how proper technique can convert winning positions and how defensive resources can save seemingly lost games. Remember: in rook endgames, activity trumps material!"

We'll examine the main line with 9.Be2 and the Four Pawns Attack, showing how Black can generate dangerous kingside attacks while White pushes for central and queenside dominance. Famous practitioners include Garry Kasparov, Viktor Korchnoi, and Bobby Fischer, who all used this opening to create masterpieces of attacking chess."
