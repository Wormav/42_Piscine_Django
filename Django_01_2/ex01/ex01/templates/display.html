<h1>Ex01: Display process of a static page</h1>
<p>
    The process of displaying a static web page in Django involves several key steps, from the user's request to the final response sent by the server. Here is a summary of the main stages:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>1. The user sends a request:</strong>
        <br>
        The process begins when a user enters a URL (for example, <code>/ex01/display</code>) in their browser and sends an HTTP request to the Django server.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>2. URL routing:</strong>
        <br>
        Django checks the <code>urls.py</code> file to find which view corresponds to the requested URL. If the URL matches, Django calls the associated view function.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>3. The view processes the request:</strong>
        <br>
        The view function (in <code>views.py</code>) receives the request and determines which template should be rendered. For a static page, the view simply calls <code>render()</code> with the template name (e.g., <code>display.html</code>).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>4. Template rendering:</strong>
        <br>
        Django loads the specified template and processes it. If context variables are provided, they are inserted into the template; for a static page, the template is usually rendered as-is.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>5. Sending the response:</strong>
        <br>
        The rendered HTML page is returned as an HTTP response to the user's browser, which then displays the static page.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    This process allows Django to efficiently serve static or dynamic content using its powerful template and view system.
