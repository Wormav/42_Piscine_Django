<h1>Ex01: Django, web framework.</h1>
<p>
    Django is a high-level web framework written in Python, designed to encourage rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is open source and benefits from a large community of developers around the world.
</p>

<h2>History of Django</h2>
<p>
    Django was created in 2003 by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison while they were working for the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper. Their goal was to quickly develop robust web applications to meet the newsroom's needs. The framework was released as open source under the BSD license in July 2005.
</p>
<p>
    The name "Django" pays tribute to the famous jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. Since its creation, Django has undergone many evolutions and is now one of the most popular web frameworks for Python.
</p>

<h2>Philosophy and Principles</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</strong>: Django encourages code reuse and reduces unnecessary repetition.</li>
    <li><strong>Convention over configuration</strong>: It favors conventions to simplify project configuration.</li>
    <li><strong>Security</strong>: Many built-in features protect against common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Django is designed to handle applications of all sizes, from small sites to high-traffic platforms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Main Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>A powerful Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) to interact with databases.</li>
    <li>A flexible template system to generate dynamic HTML pages.</li>
    <li>An automatically generated admin panel to manage site data.</li>
    <li>A simple and efficient URL routing system.</li>
    <li>Advanced user and permission management.</li>
    <li>Native support for internationalization and localization.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why choose Django?</h2>
<p>
    Django is especially appreciated for its comprehensive documentation, active community, and robust built-in tools. It allows you to quickly launch professional web projects while ensuring high code maintainability.
</p>
<p>
    Whether for a blog, a news site, an online store, or an API, Django offers a solid and scalable foundation for all types of web projects.
